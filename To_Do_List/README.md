**Learning and Creating a ToDo List App with JavaScript**

**Introduction**
A ToDo List app is a simple yet effective way to manage tasks and stay organized. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of building a basic ToDo List app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Prerequisites**
 - Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 - A code editor (such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom).
 - A web browser (such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari).
 - Getting Started

*Step 1: Set Up Your Project*
Create a new directory for your project and set up the following files:

 - index.html: The HTML file for the ToDo List app.
 - style.css: The CSS file for styling the app.
 - script.js: The JavaScript file for adding functionality to the app.

*Step 2: Design the User Interface*
Design the user interface of your ToDo List app using HTML and CSS. Define the structure of the app, including input fields, buttons, and the list area where tasks will be displayed.

*Step 3: Add Functionality with JavaScript*
Use JavaScript to add functionality to your ToDo List app. Implement features such as adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, deleting tasks, and saving tasks to local storage.

**Features**
Here are some key features you can include in your ToDo List app:

 - Add Task: Allow users to add new tasks to the list.
 - Mark as Complete: Enable users to mark tasks as complete by clicking on them.
 - Delete Task: Allow users to delete tasks from the list.
 - Save to Local browser: Save tasks to local storage so they persist even after the browser is closed.
 - Responsive Design: Ensure that the app is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
